# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Generating Images of People

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic images of people. The model is trained on a dataset of human faces, allowing it to produce high-quality, synthetic images that resemble real photographs.

## Features

- **Image Generation**: Generate new images of people based on learned features from training data.
- **Customizable Architecture**: Modify the network architecture to experiment with different configurations.
- **Training Visualization**: Visualize training progress and generated images over epochs.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language for implementing the GAN.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow, used for building and training the GAN.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training progress and generated images.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: For image processing and handling.
